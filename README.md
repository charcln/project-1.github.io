<b>Reware Modern</b>

Reware Modern is an online fashion brand for men. The brand aims to provide contemporary clothing, shoes and accessories for the modern man without breaking the bank and compromising quality.


<b>UX</b>

The website propritises the mobile experience since users tend to shop on their phones more these days. All pictures have been compressed to ensure fast loading times. When a user first enters the website, the first thing they will probably lay eyes on would be either the announcement bar or the hero section. The announcement bar is intentionally placed on the top of the page and made obvious to effectively convey its message. As for the hero section, it is meant to be eye-catching for marketing of latest releases and futher announcements. Below the hero section is a horizontally scrollable section of Reware Modern's featured products. This feature is trendy these days and it is what users are accustomed to as most e-commerce websites do use this carousel-like feature. It is easy on the eyes and users can also navigate, add to bag and view brief details of the products at a single glance. In case the user is not enticed by the featured products, we have below "Our Categories" - tops, bottoms, accessories and shoes, obviously displayed so that they know that they do have the option to browse our categories and they can do so easily. The newsletter opt-in is straight to the point. Upon entering user details, the text and border changes color to black and this was intentionally done for user interaction. The Instagram feed was placed to show brand credibility on the website so that users are able to trust Reware Modern more as a brand. By clicking on @rewaremodern, the user is brought to the official Instagram page where they can stalk and follow with ease. Lastly, we have the footer menu which is differently styled for mobile and desktop versions, both very easy to use. The mobile one is more interactive as it is a collapsible type.
